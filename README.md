This is my humble attempt of setting up an effiecent framework that utilizes all the new testing tools.

    Below is a map with the framework specs:
      {
      "Programming-language":"Java8"
      "Project-Module":"Maven"
      "Framework-Type":"BBD-Cucmber"
      "Browser-Automation":"Selenium"
      "Assertions":"JUnit"
      "Reporting":"Cucumber"
      "Reports-Type":"html,json"
      "CI\CD":"not-implemented-yet"
      }
